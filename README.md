eo_ai
=====
"eo_ai" is shorthand for "Even-Odd Artificial Intelligence", and is a basic implementation of the game [Nim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim). There are 15 objects in a pile, and each player can choose to remove at least one on their turn. However, the goal is to wind up with an _odd_ number of objects once they have all been taken.

The goal was to design a computer AI that would play the game optimally, which turns out to be fairly complicated. Luckily, there were only 45 states to consider!
